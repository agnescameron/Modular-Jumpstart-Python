The Bank of England's chief economist said on Wednesday that plans by Liz Truss for a freeze in energy bills for households and businesses was likely to force the central bank to raise interest rates despite bringing down the rate of inflation in the months ahead.

Asked by MPs on the House of Commons Treasury select committee specifically about whether the package would mean higher interest rates, Huw Pill said: In response to the question, will fiscal policies generate inflation — we are here to ensure that they don't generate inflation. Our remit is to get inflation back to target. 

We do have work to do, he added.

The comments by Pill, who was appearing alongside governor Andrew Bailey and two other Monetary Policy Committee members, came after they were repeatedly asked by MPs to comment on the new UK prime minister's expected £150bn-plus rescue package that will be met by government borrowing.

Bailey declined to comment specifically on the expected bailout explaining that the government had yet to announce the measures, which Truss confirmed she would outline on Thursday. But he added: We have to take the actions we have to take to hit the inflation target, hard as though those may be in terms of the consequences, explaining the bank's focus was on bringing inflation back down to its 2 per cent target.

Pill told the committee that the energy crisis was hitting households hard. High gas prices have an income implication for the UK, adding that if the pain was absorbed by increased public borrowing it would have two effects on inflation.

In the coming months, the effect of freezing energy bills would probably stop inflation rising much further this autumn from the 10.1 per cent level it reached in July, he said. This will lower headline inflation relative to what we were forecasting in our August report.
