This folder contains a set of example Python files for the MA/MSc Modular Jumpstart course. Each folder corresponds to material covered each day of the course. The files are meant as example templates: one way to use them is to copy them, run them locally, and then experiment with changing them around.

For a guide on how to run Python files, take a look at this [video](https://youtu.be/QGpI0ce0P54).
